# Automatic Machines Simulator - Atom plugin

## A. Description

Atom plugin to support syntax highlighting for the **machine description language** described at the root of this project. Uses a [TextMate Language Grammar](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) file to describe the syntax and tokens of the machine description language.

## B. Installation

You need to :
 - Copy this folder inside the `.atom/packages` folder.
